# FountainOfObjects

This is a textbased game. Written in Visual Studio Code.

You move around in a dark cave, searching through different rooms looking for the Fountain of Objects.

The code is my solution to a challenge posed in the book The C# Player's Guide.
All code in this solution is written by me. And I added several extra things to the game.
- Random map generation
- Equipment and an inventory for the player
- Flexible solution allowing for adding new rooms of any kind imaginable (monsters, dangers, treasures etc.)
- Flexible item system with the possibility to add new items
- A help menu showing all action commands when typing 'help'
- A codex explaning how the game works. Accessible by typing the command 'codex'
